# BlogWebpage-with-Database

This is the Version2 to my blogWepage. Here, I have connected to the web application to MongoDB Databse using 'mongoose'.
This database is very efficient to be used for big Data, like in our search engines. After this application, I have even better grip on CRUD operations on Database!!
